    "This final project explores the best locations for Italian restaurants throughout the city of New York. Food Business News stated that worldwide pasta sales were up for the second year in a row with the United Sates holding the largest market (Donley, 2018). New York is a major metropolitan area with more than 8.4 million (Quick Facts, 2018) people living within city limits. Most of the Italian immigration into the United States occurred during the late 19th and early 20th century with over two million immigrants between 1900 and 1910. Italian families first settled in Little Italy’s neighborhood around Mulberry Street as has continued to thrive ever since. With almost 700,000 Manhattan inhabitants reporting Italian ancestry, the need to find and enjoy Italian cuisine is on the rise. This report explores which neighborhoods and boroughs of New York City have the most as well as the best Italian restaurants. Additionally, I will attempt to answer the questions “Where should I open an Italian Restaurant?” and “Where should I stay If I want great Italian food?”"
